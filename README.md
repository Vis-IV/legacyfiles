# legacyfiles
For old files that I want to make open-source. 

Thank you for your interest in this! File types you will see are: .rbxl, .blend

Please do remember that more files will be uploaded to this. The original files names will stay, but will have in parentheses simplified names so you don't need to go digging around.
